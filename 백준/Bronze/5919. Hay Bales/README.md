### 문제 설명

<p>The cows are at it again!  Farmer John has carefully arranged N (1 <= N <= 10,000) piles of hay bales, each of the same height.  When he isn't looking, however, the cows move some of the hay bales between piles, so their heights are no longer necessarily the same.  Given the new heights of all the piles, please help Farmer John determine the minimum number of hay bales he needs to move in order to restore all the piles to their original, equal heights.</p>

### 입력 

 <ul><li>Line 1: The number of piles, N (1 <= N <= 10,000).</li><li>Lines 2..1+N: Each line contains the number of hay bales in a single pile (an integer in the range 1...10,000).</li></ul>

### 출력 

 <ul><li>Line 1: An integer giving the minimum number of hay bales that need to be moved to restore the piles to having equal heights.</li></ul>
